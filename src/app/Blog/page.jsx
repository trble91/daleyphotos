        The concept of still imagery revolves around composing shots, with the rule of thirds playing a crucial role. This technique often results in captivating and well-structured images, which can be enhanced through post-production editing.
        
        On the following page, you'll find my preferred camera settings for photography. Letâ€™s briefly discuss some key terms and their interrelation:
        
        1. **Aperture**: The opening through which light enters, located where the lens attaches to the camera body.
        2. **Shutter Speed**: The duration the shutter remains open. Imagine blinking slowly versus quickly to understand the difference in exposure.
        3. **ISO**: Determines an image's brightness; higher ISO levels increase brightness but can add noise.
        
        When these elements work together, along with the appropriate lens (focal length), an image can truly come to life. Lighting and angles are also crucial. For example, when using a backdrop, place the subject 3 feet in front of it. For light backdrops, set the lights three stops higher than those on the subject, and for dark backdrops, do the opposite.
        
        By understanding and manipulating these settings, you can create stunning and well-composed shots.

        Portraits:
        - ISO: 100
        - Aperture: F/1.8
        - Shutter: 1/1250
        
        Lifestyle:
        - ISO: Adjust as needed
        - Aperture: F/1.8
        - Shutter: 1/1200
        
        *These shots will be better when composed properly.
